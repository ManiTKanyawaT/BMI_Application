# BMI Calculator ðŸ’ª

## Our Goal

The objective of this tutorial is to look at how we can customise Flutter Widgets to achieve our own beautiful user interface designs. 

We have made a Body Mass Index Calculator inspired by the beautiful designs. It will be a multi screen app with simple functionality but full-on custom styling.
